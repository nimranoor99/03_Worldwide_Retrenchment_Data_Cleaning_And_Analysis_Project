**Data Cleaning**
<br>
The data_cleaning.md file outlines the SQL queries used to cleanse the raw retrenchment data. Key cleaning operations include:

* **Data Validation:** Ensuring data integrity and consistency by checking for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
* **Data Transformation:** Converting data types, handling null values, and normalizing data for analysis.
* **Data Standardization:** Standardizing data formats and units to facilitate comparison and analysis.
<br>

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
<br>
The exploratory_data_analysis.md file showcases the exploratory analysis conducted on the cleaned data. The analysis explores:

* **Retrenchment Trends:** Identifying trends in retrenchment frequency, magnitude, and geographical distribution over time.
* **Industry Analysis:** Examining retrenchment patterns across different companies, such as Google, Microsft. Comparing retrenchment rates and impacts in various regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and others.
* **Impact Assessment:** Analyzing the potential economic and social consequences of retrenchment, such as unemployment rates and job losses.
<br>

**Key Takeaways**
<br>
Through this analysis, we uncover valuable insights into the global retrenchment landscape, including:

* **Emerging Trends:** Identifying emerging trends in retrenchment, such as automation-driven job losses and economic downturns.
* **Regional Disparities:** Understanding the disparities in retrenchment impacts across different regions.
* **Industry Vulnerability:** Assessing the vulnerability of certain industries to retrenchment.
* **Policy Implications:** Providing insights for policymakers to mitigate the negative consequences of retrenchment.
<br>

**Project Highlights**
<br>
* **Comprehensive Data Cleaning:** Rigorous data cleaning process to ensure data quality and reliability.
* **Advanced SQL Techniques:** Effective use of SQL for data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis.
* **In-Depth Exploration:** Thorough exploration of retrenchment trends, patterns, and impacts.
* **Clear and Concise Documentation:** Well-structured documentation to facilitate understanding and reproducibility.
<br>

**Conclusion**
<br>
This project demonstrates a strong foundation in data cleaning, SQL, and exploratory data analysis. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for businesses, policymakers, and researchers interested in understanding the global retrenchment landscape.
